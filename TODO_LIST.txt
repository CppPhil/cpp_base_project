project structure:
    bin      : executables
    deps     : dependencies
    doc      : documentation
    include  : header files
    lib      : static and shared libraries
    obj      : object files
    src      : source files
    test/src : test sources

write application / library / tests to test all the dependencies
    - try to test something that requires boost to be built
    - build it all into a seperate obj folder, but have the executables to bin.
    - make the CMakeLists.txt file for all that stuff.
      - look here: https://github.com/CppPhil/vcpkg_example/blob/master/how_to.md
        for the vcpkg.cmake file path thing.
    - The application thing should only really have the main.cpp
    - The library thing should be a statically linked library containing
      everything else, except for the tests.
    - The tests should be just the test application, linking with the statically
      linked library.
    - Option to build in debug mode
      - Including debugging symbols (-g typically) for GNU/Linux.
    - Option to build in release mode
      - Including optimizations (-O3 as well as -march=native)
    - Add Warnings flags (including Wstrict-aliasing)
    - Add Doxyfile to generate documentation into seperate docs folder
    - Add Windows support
      - Allow building for x86 on Windows if possible.
    - Add travis as well as appveyor CI
      - Add some static analysis into the CI
        - Add UBSAN in CI
        - Add thread sanitizer in CI
        - Add address sanitizer in CI
        - Add valgrind support in CI

setup stuff for use with Visual Studio Code.
    - test building debug / release
    - test building x86 / x64 on Windows if possible.
    - test rebuilding
    - test cleaning.
    - test debugging
    - make sure all the files end up in the right places

add instructions on how to use the stuff into a README.md file.
    - Add links to the documentation for the dependencies.
