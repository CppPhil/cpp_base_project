project structure:
    bin      : executables
    build    : build scripts and artifacts
    deps     : dependencies
    doc      : documentation
    include  : header files
    lib      : static and shared libraries
    src      : source files
    test/src : test sources

write application / library / tests to test all the dependencies
    - try to test something that requires boost to be built
    - build it all into a seperate obj folder, but have the executables to bin.
    - make the CMakeLists.txt file for all that stuff.
      - Don't use file GLOB, add all the sources manually.
      - look here: https://github.com/CppPhil/vcpkg_example/blob/master/how_to.md
        for the vcpkg.cmake file path thing.
    - The application thing should only really have the main.cpp
    - The library thing should be a statically linked library containing
      everything else, except for the tests.
    - The tests should be just the test application, linking with the statically
      linked library.
    - Test with something that requires threads.
    - Option to build in debug mode
      - Including debugging symbols (-g typically) for GNU/Linux.
    - Option to build in release mode
      - Including optimizations (-O3 as well as -march=native)
        - Also add additional optmization flags such as -funroll-loops etc.
    - Add Warnings flags (including Wstrict-aliasing)
    - Option in the CMakeLists.txt to set one of the GSL assert modes
      // 1. GSL_TERMINATE_ON_CONTRACT_VIOLATION: std::terminate will be called (default)
      // 2. GSL_THROW_ON_CONTRACT_VIOLATION: a gsl::fail_fast exception will be thrown
      // 3. GSL_UNENFORCED_ON_CONTRACT_VIOLATION: nothing happens
    - make it so that there can be a setup bash script that'll be run
      after having fetched the git dependencies to set 'em up.
    - make it so that there's some file that contains all the packages to
      fetch via git
    - make it so that there's some file that contains all the packages to
      fetch via vcpkg
    - Add clang-format
      - Add some script in the root directory of the project to run clang-format
        - Have it go into the src, include and test subdirectories and invoke
          the fmt.sh / fmt.bat shell scripts from there.       
// TODO: HERE
    - Add Doxyfile to generate documentation into seperate doc folder
    
    clang-format's not using the .clang-format file
    
    - Add Windows support
      - Allow building for x86 on Windows if possible.
    - Add travis as well as appveyor CI
      - Add some static analysis into the CI
        - Add UBSAN in CI
        - Add thread sanitizer in CI
        - Add address sanitizer in CI
        - Add valgrind support in CI

setup stuff for use with Visual Studio Code.
    - test building debug / release
    - test building x86 / x64 on Windows if possible.
    - test rebuilding
    - test cleaning.
    - test debugging
    - see if there's some way to make it be able to run clang-format 
      automatically.
    - make sure all the files end up in the right places
    - make sure that you can just use it out of the box after having cloned it.

add instructions on how to use the stuff into a README.md file.
    - Add links to the documentation for the dependencies.
document the directory structure etc.
add clang format

document the prerequisites required
